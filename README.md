# WordPress Reset

There are two important reasons as to why I built this plugin:

1. I wanted a simple and painless way to obtain a fresh clean database without actually having to reinstall WordPress.
2. 9 times out of 10 I get tons of excess junk in the wp_options table after installing plugins and themes that do not clean up after themselves.

I have more ideas in how I could potentially improve this script but in the mean time, works fine for me ! :)
